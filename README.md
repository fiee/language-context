# language-context package

This package adds the support of ConTeXt language in Atom, with syntax highlighting.

It has been ported from <https://github.com/pgundlach/context.tmbundle> via automatic
apm conversion, but it has been (and it is being) refined and cleaned up by myself.

See <http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page> for details about ConTeXt typesetting language.
