# language-context

This package adds the support of ConTeXt language in Atom, with syntax highlighting.

It has been ported from this [TextMate package](<https://github.com/pgundlach/context.tmbundle>): it was ported using automatic *apm* conversion, but it has been (and it is being) refined and cleaned up by me.

See [here](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) for details about ConTeXt typesetting language.
